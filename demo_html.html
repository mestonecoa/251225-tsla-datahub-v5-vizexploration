		<title> The tag for this content is "title". These words are the content, otherwise called "text node". The entire bit from &lt;title&gt; blah &lt;/title&gt; is called element.</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>starting the body now. Although &lt;p&gt;is not required for texts, it is the best practice. p is for paragraph. </p>
		<span>p will get it's own block, while span will be inline. btw. </span>
		<h1>This is h1 title</h1>
		<h2>This is h2 title. aka Subtitle</h2>
		<h3>This is h3 title.</h3>
		<h4>This is h4 title.</h4>
		<h5>This is h5 title.</h5>
		<h6>This is h6 title.</h6>
		<p>Best practice is to not jump more than one hierarch of h{number}s</p>
		<img src="random_sora_img.jpg">This is a random generated Sora image. <span>Attribute src must be included in the tag. This text is a span element nested inside the content of an img element btw.</span></img>
		<a href="https://github.com/mestonecoa">This is my Github account</a>
		<p> Now on to unordered lists. It can only have &lt;li&gt; elements as children. No span, no p no nothing.<p>
		<ul>
			<li>NY</li>
			<li>LA</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Now on to ordered lists.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Get out.</li>
			<li>Walk.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Input element with type attribute as text</p>
		<input type="text" placeholder="some placeholder" required>
